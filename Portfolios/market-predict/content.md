# 📈 Stock Market Prediction Web App

This project is a full-stack stock market prediction platform built to bridge the gap between **machine learning models and real-world user experience**. It enables users to explore historical stock price data and view future price predictions generated using data-driven models — all through a fast, responsive, and intuitive web interface.

Rather than focusing solely on prediction accuracy, the goal of this project was to design a **production-style system** where data flows cleanly from model to backend API and finally into a polished frontend. The project reflects my interest in **applied machine learning**, **scalable backend systems**, and **clean, user-focused data visualization**, instead of isolated or experimental ML notebooks.

## ✨ Overview

This application demonstrates an **end-to-end ML-powered web product**, combining data collection, preprocessing, predictive modeling, backend API design, and frontend visualization.

The core focus areas were:
- Maintaining a clean **frontend–backend separation**
- Integrating **machine learning in a practical, usable way**
- Delivering a **responsive and accessible UI** across devices

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📊 Interactive visualization of historical stock price data  
- 🤖 Machine learning–based prediction of future price trends  
- 🌐 RESTful backend API handling data processing and inference  
- 📱 Fully responsive design optimized for desktop and mobile  
- 🔄 Dynamic data fetching with real-time chart updates

## 🧠 System Workflow

1. The user selects a stock from the frontend interface  
2. The frontend sends a request to the backend REST API  
3. The backend:
   - Fetches and preprocesses historical stock data  
   - Runs the processed data through the prediction model  
4. Predicted values are returned to the frontend  
5. The frontend renders predictions using interactive charts
